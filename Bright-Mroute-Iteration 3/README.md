The iteration 3 version of the bright mroute.

Open the Mroute folder.

You can see all the view controllers of the bright-mroute, and the code is readable. 

In iteration 3, we have added the login and sign up page for user, and when the user logged into the home page, the user can see the local weather information based on the user's current location.

And the cyclist feature is added as well! User now can choose different bike route to enjoy the ride! We also provide you the bike station location on the map so that user can navigate to the nearest bike station to rent a bike! 

The quiz has added the bike questions. User now can choose to attempt different questions, either car or bike.
